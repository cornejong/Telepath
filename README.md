# Telepath
Simple PHP RPC Framework

### The basics
Telepath is a very simple, basic and crude RPC Framework for remote code execution.
Current version instantiates a class when a function of the class is called. 
Next version will implement states and will allow for session based use of classes.
Maintaining the class state and values throughout the session. This is currently in development.
